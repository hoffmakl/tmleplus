tmleplus

Generalized functions produced from code written by Dr. Ivan Diaz to calculate additional effects and standard errors from various types of tmle objects.

To install:

```devtools::install_github("hoffmakl/tmleplus")```

Fit objects come from R packages (tmle)[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmle/tmle.pdf], `ltmle`, `survtmle`, or `SuperLearner` depending on the function.
